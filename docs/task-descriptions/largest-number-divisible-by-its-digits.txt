Largest Number Divisible By Its Digits


Find the largest base 10 integer whose digits are all different,   and   is evenly divisible by each
 of its individual digits.

Task

These numbers are also known as   Lynch-Bell numbers, numbers n such that the (base ten) digits are 
all different (and do not include zero) and n is divisible by each of its individual digits.

Example

135 is evenly divisible by 1, 3, and  5.

Note that the digit zero (0) can not be in the number as integer division by zero is undefined.

The digits must all be unique so a base ten number will have at most 9 digits.

Feel free to use analytics and clever algorithms to reduce the search space your example needs
to visit, but it must do an actual search. (Don't just feed it the answer and verify it is
correct.)

;; Regarding the solution space:

;; 1. None of these numbers can have more than 10 digits, since that would mean 
;; repeating a digit.

;; 2. None of them can have 10 digits, since 0 is not permitted.

;; 3. None can have 9 digits, because we must use both 2 and 5. Any 
;;    number that has both 2 and 5 as factors must end in 0, and 
;;    0 is not a permitted digit.

;; 4. If the number has 8 digits, 5 must be omitted. This is because, with
;;    eight digits, we must have at least three even numbers. If any even
;;    number is a factor and 5 is a factor, the number will end in 0, which 
;;    is not permitted.

;; 5. That 8 digit number must contain one of each of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.
;;    The sum of these numbers is 40. But a number is divisible by 9 only if 
;;    the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. And 40 is not divisible by 9. 
;;    so there are no 8-digit numbers in this set, either.

;; 6. 7-digit numbers. Again, 5 must not be present. That leaves us with
;;    one other digit to omit.
;;    Assume that we do not omit 9. Then the sum of digits must be divisible by
;;    9. The sum of digits 1-4 and 6-9 = 40. For the digit sum to be divisible by 9,
;;    we must omit 4 (36 is the digit sum in that case). No other choice. Now, assume
;;    we choose to omit 9. The divisibilty rules say that if we subtract the number of
;;    digits 2, 5, and 8 from the number of digits 1, 4, and 7, and the result is divisible
;;    by 3, then the number is divisible by 3. We have 2 and 8, which is 2. We have
;;    1, 4 and 7. That is 3. 3-2 = 1, which is not divisible by 3.
;;    Thus, a 7 digit number must lack 0, 4, 5 and contain all other digits.

;; Divisible by 9: covers 1 and 3
;; Divisible by 8: covers 2 (and 4). 6 now covered
;; Divisible by 7
;; 6 is covered
;; 5 is excluded
;; 4 is excluded
;; 3, 2, 1 are covered

;; The number must be divisible by 504.

;; What about base 16?
;; Using similar logic,

;; 1. The largest divigible in base 16 cannot have 16 digits because 0 is forbidden.
;; 2. If 8 is present with any other even number, the result will end in 0, which is
;;    is forbidden. Thus, it cannot have 8, and it cannot have 15 digits.
;; 3. Here are the divisibility rules for hex
;;    1: all numbers
;;    2: last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E
;;    3: sum of digits is divisible by 3
;;    4: last digit is 0, 4, 8, C
;;    5: sum of digits is divisible by 5
;;    6: divisible by 2 and 3
;;    7: ?
;;    8: last digit is 0 or 8
;;    9: ?
;;    A: divisible by 2 and 5
;;    B: ?
;;    C: Divisible by 3 and 4
;;    D: ?
;;    E: Divisible by 2 and 7
;;    F: Sum of digits divisible by F

;; Since, of the 6 remaining even numbers, we may have at most 3 appear
;; in the number, we now know that the number can have no more than 11
;; digits. Furthermore, if it has 11 digits, 4 and C must be excluded.
;; This leaves us with one more even digit to exclude. This means all odd
;; digits must be included.
;; The number must be divisible by

;; 4. If we make a prime factorization of the product of the
;;    digits, and the power of 2 is 4 or greater,
;;    the number will end in 0. We have already excluded 0 and 8.
;;    This leaves us with 2, 4, 6, A, C, E
;;    Here are the permissable combinations of even
;;    digits
;;    2, 4
;;    2, 6, A
;;    2, 6, E
;;    2, A, E
;;    4, A
;;    4, E
;;    6, A, E
;;    6, C
;;    6, E
;;    A, C
;;    A, E
;;    C, E

;; Now, the digit sum must be divisible by F = 15.
;; Given 12 digits, the digit sum is 96. We must exclude
;; 6 to arrive at an 11 digit number whose digit sum is
;; divisible by F. So our 11-digit number must not have
;; 0, 4, 6, 8, or C among its digits.

;; For now, we can assume that the largest divigible in base 16
;; will
;; be 11 digits long
;; contain all digits except 0, 4, 6, 8 and C.
;; We can narrow the search space by remembering that the
;; It will be divisible by F=15 (covering 1, 3, 5)
;; It will be divisible by E=14 (covering 2, 7), now A is covered
;; It will be divisible by D=13
;; C is excluded
;; It will be divisible by B=11
;; A is covered
;; Since it must be divisible by 9, and extra 3 factor is required
;; 8 is forbidden
;; 7 is covered
;; 6 is excluded
;; 5 is covered
;; 4 is excluded
;; 3, 2, 1 are covered.

;; Our number must be divisible by 90090.
