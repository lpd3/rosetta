Conversion to a proper project

1. Extract all tasks to separate files
2. Research project structure: posible to load on an as needed basis?
3. Move project statements to a directory
4. Run programs and store output into a directory
5. Write a gateway main program, which allows for choosing a task,
   along with its statement, optional. Make sure it can load new projects.

All dependencies should be loaded at package loading.
